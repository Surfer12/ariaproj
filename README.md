## ‚ú® Purpose

This framework is part of an interdisciplinary vision to combine **symbolic rigor**, **neural adaptability**, and **cognitive-aligned reasoning**. It reflects years of integrated work at the intersection of computer science, biopsychology, and meta-epistemology.

It is not just software. It is a **cognitive architecture**, and its use is **ethically bounded**.

# Project Aria: Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework

## Overview
This repository contains research, models, and implementation plans for a novel cognitive architecture integrating Project Aria's egocentric perception with adaptive, recursive self-modifying processes.

## Directory Structure

- **MainDoc/**: Main research proposals and implementation guidelines
- **aria-init/**: Diagrams, cognitive models, and visualizations
- **claudeNotes/**: Communication, style, and process notes
- **docs/**: Project summaries and public-facing documentation
- **src/**: Code, functions, and scripts
- **archive/**: Legacy drafts and Q&A

## Getting Started

1. Read `MainDoc/Project Aria Research Proposal.md` for the core research vision
2. Explore `aria-init/diagrams/` for system and cognitive architecture visualizations
3. See `claudeNotes/` for communication and process guidelines

## Latest Updates

- Organized directory structure for better navigation
- Separated diagrams, models, and documentation
- Archived legacy drafts for historical reference
