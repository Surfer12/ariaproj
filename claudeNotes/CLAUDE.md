# Development Guidelines for Aria Research Project

## Project Structure
- Research documents are stored in the `aria-init/` directory
- Main project file is `aria.md` in the root directory

## Development Environment
- For markdown editing, use a modern text editor with markdown support
- For diagram visualization, use Mermaid compatible viewers

## Documentation Guidelines
- Write clear, concise documentation with proper headings
- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include diagrams and visualizations where appropriate
- Document complex cognitive models thoroughly

## Cognitive Model Structure
- Follow the recursive cognitive integration framework
- Implement dynamic cognitive boundary management
- Enable self-modifying parameter systems
- Structure using layers: Understanding → Analysis → Exploration → Reflection → Meta-Observation

## Best Practices
- Maintain cross-references between related documents
- Use consistent terminology across all documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with current research findings
- Follow recursive self-examination processes for all models

## Research Methodology
- Integrate multi-modal data sources
- Apply sparse encoding techniques to sensory data
- Implement meta-cognitive feedback loops
- Document all experimental parameters for reproducibility
