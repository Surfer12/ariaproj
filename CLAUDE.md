# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

The Fractal Communication Framework (FCF) is a system for recursive thought processing with meta-cognitive monitoring capabilities. It implements a modular architecture for conversational AI applications that can adapt responses through reflection, anchoring, and synthesis while maintaining awareness of cognitive processes.

## Repository Structure

The project has several key components:

- **MainDoc/**: Contains main research proposals and documentation for the Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework
- **aria-init/**: Houses diagrams, specifications, cognitive models, and visualization files
- **claudeNotes/**: Includes supplementary documentation and development notes

## Technical Architecture

The Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework consists of five interconnected layers:

1. **Sensory Input**: Processes multi-modal data from Project Aria sensors
2. **Sparse Encoding**: Implements selective feature activation mimicking human attention
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies temporal-spatial regularities across multiple timescales
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Integrates information across modalities and timeframes
5. **Meta-Cognitive Feedback**: Enables continuous self-examination and adaptation

The system follows a recursive computational framework that continuously refines its own operation through self-examination.

## Planned Implementation Stack

The implementation will utilize these technologies:

- **Core Architecture**: Python/Java for primary framework implementation
- **Performance-Critical Components**: Mojo and Rust for computationally intensive operations
- **Model Implementation**: PyTorch with metal performance shaders
- **Visualization**: Swift for data visualization and user interfaces
- **Configuration**: YAML for system configuration and cognitive model representation

## Development Commands

### Python Components (Planned)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .

# Run tests
python run_tests.py
python tests.py

# Type checking and linting
mypy src/python/
flake8 src/python/
```

### Java Components (Planned)

```bash
# Gradle build
./gradlew build
./gradlew test

# Maven build
mvn -B clean package
mvn -B test
```

### Mojo Components (Planned)

```bash
# Install dependencies 
magic install

# Run Mojo code
magic run mojo main.mojo
```

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Guidelines

- Write clear, concise documentation with proper markdown formatting
- Include diagrams and visualizations using Mermaid syntax
- Document complex cognitive models thoroughly
- Maintain consistent terminology across all documentation

### Cognitive Model Structure

- Follow the recursive cognitive integration framework
- Implement dynamic cognitive boundary management
- Enable self-modifying parameter systems
- Structure using layers: Understanding → Analysis → Exploration → Reflection → Meta-Observation

### Evaluation Framework

The system will be evaluated through multiple approaches:

- **Predictive Accuracy**: Comparison against ground truth data
- **Adaptive Performance**: Measurement of adaptation rate to novel environments
- **Computational Efficiency**: Sparse activation density analysis
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Boundary adaptation in response to novel categories
- **Flow State Correlation**: Detection of optimal cognitive states

## Development Process

The project follows a three-phase development approach:

1. **Foundation Phase**:
   - Implement core architecture
   - Develop sparse encoding mechanisms
   - Create basic pattern recognition algorithms
   - Establish baseline performance metrics

2. **Integration Phase**:
   - Build recursive self-examination processes
   - Implement dynamic cognitive boundary management
   - Develop temporal-spatial pattern recognition algorithms
   - Create meta-cognitive parameter adjustment mechanisms

3. **Refinement Phase**:
   - Optimize performance across computational platforms
   - Implement advanced cognitive state detection
   - Develop visualization tools for system state representation
   - Create comprehensive evaluation framework
