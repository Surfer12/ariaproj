# CLAUDE.md - Project Aria Research Proposal

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Project Aria Research Proposal for developing a Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework (RCIF), featuring the Cognitive Sparse Encoded Architecture (CSEA) for dynamic cognitive boundary management and self-modifying parameter systems.

**Key Innovation:** Cognitive Sparse Encoded Architecture (CSEA) with dynamic boundary management.

**Project Status:** Research

## Repository Structure

- **MainDoc/**: Research proposal documents and drafts
- **aria-init/**: Architectural specifications and diagrams
- **claudeNotes/**: Supplementary development notes

## Build and Development Commands

### Python Components

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .

# Run tests
python run_tests.py
pytest tests/

# Type checking and linting
mypy src/python/
flake8 src/python/
```

### Java Components

```bash
# Gradle build (if applicable)
./gradlew build
./gradlew test
```

### Mojo Components

```bash
# Install dependencies
magic install

# Run Mojo code
magic run mojo main.mojo
```

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Guidelines

- Write clear, concise documentation with proper markdown formatting
- Include diagrams and visualizations using Mermaid syntax
- Maintain consistent terminology across all documentation

### Cognitive Model Structure

- Follow the recursive cognitive integration framework
- Implement dynamic cognitive boundary management
- Enable self-modifying parameter systems
- Structure using layers: Understanding → Analysis → Exploration → Reflection → Meta-Observation

### Evaluation Framework

- Predictive Accuracy: Comparison against ground truth data
- Adaptive Performance: Measurement of adaptation rate to novel environments
- Computational Efficiency: Sparse activation density analysis
- Cognitive Flexibility: Boundary adaptation in response to novel categories
- Flow State Correlation: Detection of optimal cognitive states

## Important Notes

- This project is in the research proposal phase; no implementation exists yet.
- Refer to the Unified Development Ethos for ecosystem-wide guidelines
